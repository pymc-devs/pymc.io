## Intro

We are excited to share that the PyMC project is once again participating in [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/02/meet-mentoring-organizations-of-gsoc.html) under the [NumFOCUS umbrella](https://github.com/numfocus/gsoc/blob/master/2025/ideas-list.md).

## Getting started

:::{attention}
New contributors should first read the [contributing guide](https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/latest/contributing/index.html) and learn the basics of [PyTensor](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pytensor). Also they should read through some of the [examples](https://docs.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/) in the [PyMC docs](https://docs.pymc.io). 
:::

To be considered as a GSoC student, you should make a PR to PyMC / PyTensor. It can be something small, like a doc fix or simple bug fix. Some [beginner friendly issues](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/labels/beginner%20friendly) have been tagged.

If you are a student interested in participating, please contact us [on our PyMC Discourse site](https://discourse.pymc.io/).


## Project Ideas

Below is a list of possible topics for your GSoC project, **we are also open to other topics**, contact us on [Discourse](https://discourse.pymc.io/).
Keep in mind that these are only ideas and that some of them can't be completely solved in a single GSoC project.
When writing your proposal, choose some specific tasks and make sure your proposal is adequate for the GSoC time commitment. 

:::{note}
   **We expect all projects to be 350h projects**, if you'd like to be considered for a 175h project you _must_ reach out on [Discourse](https://discourse.pymc.io/). We will *not* accept 175h applications from people with whom we have not discussed their time commitments before submitting the application.
:::

We have [these PyMC GSoC 2025 projects](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/wiki/GSoC-2025-projects):

1. [Spatial Modeling](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/wiki/GSoC-2025-projects#spatial-modeling)
1. [Implement New Statespace Models](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/wiki/GSoC-2025-projects#implement-new-statespace-models)
1. You may propose another idea.
