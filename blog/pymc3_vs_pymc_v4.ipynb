    "# PyMC 4.0 Release Announcement\n",
    ":::{post} Apr 4, 2022\n",
    ":tags: release, aesara, jax\n",
    ":category: news\n",
    ":author: Thomas Wiecki\n",
    "\n",
    "We, the PyMC core development team, are incredibly excited to announce the release of a major rewrite of PyMC3 (now called just PyMC): `4.0`. This marks the first major new version in over 10 years. Internally, we have already been using PyMC 4.0 almost exclusively for many months and found it to be very stable and better in every aspect. Every user should upgrade, as there are many exciting new updates that we will talk about in this and upcoming blog posts. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pymc_versions.png\" alt=\"PyMC version history, graphic by Ravin Kumar https://twitter.com/canyon289\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Full API compatibility for model building\n",
    "To get the main question out of the way: Yes, you can just keep your existing PyMC modeling code without having to change anything (in most cases) and get all the improvements for free. The only thing most users will have to change is the import from `import pymc3 as pm` to `import pymc as pm`. For more information, see the [quick migration guide](https://www.pymc-labs.io/blog-posts/the-quickest-migration-guide-ever-from-pymc3-to-pymc-v40/). If you are using more advanced features of PyMC beyond the modeling API, you might have to change some things.\n",
    "\n",
    "## It's now called PyMC instead of PyMC3\n",
    "First, the biggest news: **PyMC3 has been renamed to PyMC. PyMC3 version 3.x will stay under the current name to not break production systems but future versions will use the PyMC name everywhere.** While there were a few reasons for this, the main one is that PyMC3 4.0 looks quite confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What about PyMC4?\n",
    "If you don't know what PyMC4 (not PyMC 4.0, which is what this blog post is about) is, you can just skip this section. In brief, it was an experiment we did using TensorFlow Probability as a backend which we gave up on. The motivation for abandoning this is described in our previous post [\"The Future of PyMC3, or: Theano is Dead, Long Live Theano\"](https://pymc-devs.medium.com/the-future-of-pymc3-or-theano-is-dead-long-live-theano-d8005f8a0e9b)\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that it's easy to get confused between the discontinued PyMC4 and this new PyMC 4.0, but we just have to deal :).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theano → Aesara\n",
    "While evaluating other tensor libraries like `TensorFlow` and `PyTorch` as new backends we realized how amazing and unique `Theano` really was. It has a mature and hackable code base and a simple graph representation that allows easy graph manipulations, something that's very useful for probabilistic programming languages. In addition, `TensorFlow` and `PyTorch` focus on a dynamic graph which is useful for some things, but for a probabilistic programming package, a static graph is actually much better, and `Theano` is the only library that provided this.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we went ahead and forked the `Theano` library and undertook a massive cleaning up of the code-base (this charge was led by [Brandon Willard](https://twitter.com/brandontwillard)), removing swaths of old and obscure code, and restructuring the entire library to be more developer friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This rewrite motivated renaming the package to [`Aesara`](https://github.com/aesara-devs/aesara) (Theano's daughter in Greek mythology). Quickly, a new developer team focused around improving `aesara` independent of `PyMC`.\n",
    "\n",
    "One major new feature is support for other computational backends, namely `JAX` and `numba`. The way this works is that `aesara` is best understood as a computational graph library that allows you to build a computational graph out of array-operations (additions, multiplications, dot-products, indexing, for-loops). From this graph representation, we can do various things:\n",
    "* graph optimizations like `log(exp(x)) -> x`\n",
    "* symbolic rewrites like `N(0, 1) + a` -> `N(a, 1)`\n",
    "* compilation of that graph to various computational backends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, `Theano` supported Python and C as computational backends. But with `aesara` it is now possible, and in fact quite easy, to add new computational backends. We have currently added a `JAX` backend that comes with GPU support (see [this blog post](https://martiningram.github.io/mcmc-comparison/) for some impressive speed-ups using GPUs for sampling). We're also in the process of adding a `numba` backend. But there are tons of other improvements to `aesara`, some of which we describe below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's new in PyMC 4.0?\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, let's get to the good stuff. What makes PyMC 4.0 so awesome?"

    "### New JAX backend for faster sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "By far the most shiny new feature is the new JAX backend and the associated speed-ups. \n",
    "\n",
    "How does it work? As mentioned above, `aesara` provides a representation of the model logp graph in form of various `aesara` `Ops` (operators) which represent the computations to be be performed. For example `exp(x + y)` would be an `Add` `Op` with two input arguments `x` and `y`. The result of the `Add` `Op` is then inputted into an `exp` `Op`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This computation graph doesn't say anything about how we actually *execute* this graph, however. Before, we would transpile this graph to C-code which would then get compiled, loaded into Python as a C-extension, and then executed. But now, we can just transpile this graph to `JAX` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this by itself is already pretty exciting, because `JAX` (through `XLA`) is capable of a whole bunch of low-level optimizations which lead to faster model evaluation, our samplers are still written in Python, so there is still some call-overhead. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get rid of this, we can link the `JAX` graph produced by `aesara` with a sampler also written in `JAX`. That way, the model logp evaluation *and* the sampler are one big JAX graph that gets optimized and executed without any Python call-overhead. We currently support a NUTS implementation provided by [`numpyro`](http://pyro.ai/numpyro/) as well as [`blackjax`](https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax).\n",
    "\n",
    "Early experiments and benchmarks show [impressive speed-ups](https://martiningram.github.io/mcmc-comparison/). Here is a small example of how much faster this is on a fairly small and simple model: the hierarchical linear regression of the famous Radon example."

The resulting `JAX` function we can then call from a sampler written in directly in `JAX` (i.e. `numpyro` or `blackjax`).\n",
    "\n",
    "While lightning fast, this is suboptimal for two reasons:\n",
    "1. For new backends, like `numba`, we would need to rewrite the sampler also in `numba`.\n",
    "2. While we get low-level optimizations from `JAX` on the logp+sampler JAX-graph, we do not get any high-level optimizations, which is what `aesara` is great at, because `aesara` does not see the sampler.\n",
    "\n",
    "With [`aehmc`](https://www.github.com/aesara-devs/aehmc) and [`aemcmc`](https://www.github.com/aesara-devs/aemcmc) the `aesara` devs are developing a library of samplers *written in `aesara`*. That way, our model logp, consisting out of `aesara` `Ops` can then be combined with the sampler logic, now also consisting out of `aesara` `Ops`, and form one big `aesara` graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "On that big graph containing model *and* sampler, `aesara` can the do high-level optimizations to get a more efficient graph representation. In a next step it can then compile it to whatever backend we want: `JAX`, `numba`, `C`, or whatever other backend we add in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think this is interesting, definitely check out these packages and consider contributing, this is where the next round of innovation will come from!"

    "## Better integration into `aesara`\n",
    "\n",
    "The next feature we are excited about is a better integration of `PyMC` into `aesara`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `PyMC3 3.x`, the random variables (RVs) created by e.g. calling `x = pm.Normal('x')` were not truly `theano` `Ops` so they did not integrate as nicely with the rest of `theano`. This created a lot of issues, limitations, and complexities in the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Aesara` now provides a proper `RandomVariable` Op which perfectly integrates with the rest of the other `Ops`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a major change in `4.0` and lead to huge swaths of brittle code in PyMC3 get removed or greatly simplified. In many ways, this change is much more exciting than the different computational backends, but the effects are not quite as visible to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few cases, however, where you can see the benefits."

    "Another big improvement in `PyMC` 4.0 is in how shapes are handled internally. Before, there was also a bunch of complicated and brittle Python code to handle shapes. Internally, we had a joke where we counted how many days had passed until we had discovered a new shape bug. But no more! Now, all shape handling is completely offloaded to `aesara` which handles this properly. As a side-effect, this better shape support also allows dynamic RV shapes, where the shape depends on another RV:"

    "As mentioned in the beginning, `aesara` is a unique library in the PyData ecosystem as it is the only one that provides a static, mutable computation graph. Having direct access to this computation graph allows for many interesting features. Above we already mentioned simplfications like turning `exp(log(x))` into `x`, and `aesara` already implements many of these. While we don't have proper benchmarks, we noticed major speed-ups of porting models from PyMC3 to 4.0, even without the JAX backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "But these graph rewrites can become much more sophisticated. For example, [a beta prior on a binomial likelihood can be replaced with its analytical solution directly by exploiting conjugacy](https://github.com/aesara-devs/aemcmc/pull/29). \n",
    "\n",
    "Or a hierarchical model written in a centered parameterization can automatically be converted to its [non-centered analog](https://twiecki.io/blog/2017/02/08/bayesian-hierchical-non-centered/) which often samples much more efficiently. These model reparameterizations can make a huge difference in how well a model samples. Unforutnately, these reparameterizations still require intimate knowledge of the math and a deep understanding of the posterior geometry, nothing a casual PyMC user would be familiar with. So with these graph rewrites we will be able to automatically reparameterize a PyMC model for you and find the configuration that samples most efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In sum, we believe PyMC 4.0 is the best version yet and pushes the state of the art in probabilistic programming. But it's also stepping stone to many more innovations to come. Thanks for being a part of it.**"
