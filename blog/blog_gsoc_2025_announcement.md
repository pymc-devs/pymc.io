## Intro

We are excited to share that the PyMC project is once again participating in [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/02/meet-mentoring-organizations-of-gsoc.html) under the [NumFOCUS umbrella](https://github.com/numfocus/gsoc/blob/master/2025/ideas-list.md).

## Getting started

:::{attention}
New contributors should first read the [contributing guide](https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/latest/contributing/index.html) and learn the basics of [PyTensor](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pytensor). Also they should read through some of the [examples](https://docs.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/) in the [PyMC docs](https://docs.pymc.io). 
:::

To be considered as a GSoC student, you should make a PR to PyMC / PyTensor. It can be something small, like a doc fix or simple bug fix. Some [beginner friendly issues](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/labels/beginner%20friendly) have been tagged.

If you are a student interested in participating, please contact us [on our PyMC Discourse site](https://discourse.pymc.io/).

## Project Ideas

Below is a list of possible topics for your GSoC project, **we are also open to other topics**, contact us on [Discourse](https://discourse.pymc.io/).
Keep in mind that these are only ideas and that some of them can't be completely solved in a single GSoC project.
When writing your proposal, choose some specific tasks and make sure your proposal is adequate for the GSoC time commitment. 

:::{note}
   **We expect all projects to be 350h projects**, if you'd like to be considered for a 175h project you _must_ reach out on [Discourse](https://discourse.pymc.io/). We will *not* accept 175h applications from people with whom we have not discussed their time commitments before submitting the application.
:::

We have [these PyMC GSoC 2025 projects](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/wiki/GSoC-2025-projects):

1. [Spatial Modeling](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/wiki/GSoC-2025-projects#spatial-modeling)
1. [Implement New Statespace Models](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/wiki/GSoC-2025-projects#implement-new-statespace-models)
1. You may propose another idea.

### Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Experience: Panel Discussion

Google Summer of Code (GSOC) is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors. In this panel discussion, we speak with several GSOC alumni of the PyMC project to learn of their experiences including the application process, mentorship experience and post-GSOC open source participation.

#### About the Panelists

**[Tirth Patel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tirthasheshpatel/)** is a maintainer of SciPy and a contributor to a few other open-source projects like NumPy, PyMC, and scikit-learn. He participated in Google Summer of Code with PyMC in 2020 and with SciPy in 2021. He works primarily with Python and C, and he also codes with C++ and Julia. He is currently a graduate computer science student at Arizona State University.

**[Larry Dong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/larry-dong/)** is a PhD student in biostatistics at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto in Toronto, Canada. He began his PhD during the pandemic which has allowed him to be immersed in open-source, particularly in the PyMC community. His first GSoC project entailed implementing a Dirichlet Process submodule for PyMC and he returned for another GSoC to continue this project and to learn more about Aesara and AePPL.

**[Oriol Abril Pla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oriol-abril-pla-1b9123180/)** has a background in engineering physics and astrophysics and currently works as a computational statistician. He is a core contributor and council member of ArviZ and PyMC projects. Oriol dedicates a lot of his time to community management and documentation because he believes they are as important as the code. He has helped organize and mentored in multiple Data Umbrella sprints. He has also mentored many new ArviZ and PyMC team members whose backgrounds ranged from computational scientist to technical writer.
