# PyMC ecosystem

## General purpose

- [Bambi](https://github.com/bambinos/bambi): BAyesian Model-Building Interface (BAMBI) in Python.
- [calibr8](https://github.com/JuBiotech/calibr8): A toolbox for constructing detailed observation models to be used as likelihoods in PyMC.
- [CausalPy](https://github.com/pymc-labs/CausalPy): A package focussing on causal inference in quasi-experimental settings.
- [SunODE](https://github.com/aseyboldt/sunode): Fast ODE solver, much faster than the one that comes with PyMC.
- [pymc-learn](https://github.com/pymc-learn/pymc-learn): Custom PyMC models built on top of pymc3_models/scikit-learn API

## Domain specific

- [Exoplanet](https://github.com/dfm/exoplanet): a toolkit for modeling of transit and/or radial velocity observations of exoplanets and other astronomical time series.
- [beat](https://github.com/hvasbath/beat): Bayesian Earthquake Analysis Tool.
