The PyMC schedule is generally as follows:

* General team meetings on the first Friday of the month
* Community team meetings on the last Friday of the month
* Office hours are recurrent events but without fixed day, time or cadence

The project {ref}`code_of_conduct` applies to all spaces.

The PyMC calendar below can be manually added to your personal calendar by clicking on the {guilabel}`+` button in the bottom right corner.
