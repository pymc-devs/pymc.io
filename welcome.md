{doc}`PyMC <pymc:index>` is a probabilistic programming library for Python that allows users to build Bayesian models with a simple Python API and fit them using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.

## Features
PyMC strives to make Bayesian modeling as simple and painless as possible, allowing users to focus on their problem rather than the methods.

Here is what sets it apart:

* **Modern**: Includes state-of-the-art inference algorithms, including MCMC (NUTS) and variational inference (ADVI).
* **User friendly**: Write your models using friendly Python syntax. [Learn Bayesian modeling](https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/latest/learn.html#) from the many [example notebooks](https://www.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/gallery.html).
* **Fast**: Uses {doc}`Aesara <aesara:index>` as its computational backend to compile to C and JAX, [run your models on the GPU](https://www.pymc-labs.io/blog-posts/pymc-stan-benchmark/), and benefit from complex graph-optimizations.
* **Batteries included**: Includes probability distributions, Gaussian processes, ABC, SMC and much more. It integrates nicely with {doc}`ArviZ <arviz:index>` for visualizations and diagnostics, as well as {doc}`Bambi <bambi:index>` for high-level mixed-effect models.
* **Community focused**: Ask questions on [discourse](https://discourse.pymc.io), join [MeetUp events](https://meetup.com/pymc-online-meetup/), follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pymc_devs), and start [contributing](https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/latest/contributing/index.html).
