The PyMC team coordinated a development hackathon in May/June 2022 to complete updates and documentation in order to release [v4.0 of the PyMC library](https://twitter.com/pymc_devs/status/1533863780601446401).

The [v4.0 release of the PyMC library](https://twitter.com/pymc_devs/status/1533863780601446401) was officially announced on June 6, 2022.  To achieve this milestone, the PyMC team planned a week-long online sprint beginning May 30, 2022.  The goal was to complete remaining issues on the v4.0 release.  But, *mainly* it was to finalize the documentation and update the website for PyMC.


And all 3 websites had separate navigation bars and it was confusing for the users, maybe for the library maintainers too?

This Dev sprint was held on the new PyMC Discord server which easily enables sharing video, camera and screen share and provides an easy way to hop between ‚Äúchannels‚Äù.  

We shared the sprint events on our new [PyMC Online Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pymc-online-meetup/events/286202420/) to involve experienced contributors in the community as well. We had a mix of core contributors and newcomers, which is a great combination, as it enables us to be productive, but also to foster the new generation of core developers. The following team members attended, from various locations around the world:  

- Thomas Wiecki (Germany)
- Ricardo Vieira (Romania)
- Christian Luhmann (New York, USA)
- Alex Andorra (France)
- Michael Osthege (Germany)
- Oriol Abril Pla (Finland)
- Chris Fonnesbeck (Nashville, USA)
- Osvaldo Martin (Argentina)
- Maxim Kochurov (Moscow, Russia)
- Reshama Shaikh (New York, USA)

The PyMC project also have begun the 2022 [Google Summer of Code](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/wiki/GSoC-2022-projects) (GSOC) program and the following GSOC folks joined:  

- Connor Hassan (Australia)
- Purna Chandra Mansingh (India)
- Danh Phan (Australia)
- Larry Dong (Canada)

A number of contributors joined from the community:  

- Fernando Irarr√°zaval
- Ivan Finaev
- percevalve
- Rob Zinkov (Germany)

There were lots of people throughout the week, and it is likely we are forgetting some folks. If we forgot you, let us know!
