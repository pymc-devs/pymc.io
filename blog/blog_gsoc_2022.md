**Bio**
>I am a final-year student at Hyderabad Central University pursuing a Master's in Computer Applications. I've been working in the fields of data science and machine learning for the past year. I enjoy working on complex problems and am a technical instructor. In my spare time, I enjoy contributing what I've learned to open-source projects.

1. __What motivated you to apply for GSoC with PyMC?__
    GSoC is a place where I can not only apply my existing skills but also learn new ones. And the learning does not stop with technical knowledge. GSoC introduces me to a new paradigm for collaboratively developing code. Furthermore, GSoC is a platform that allows me to build on and hone my current skills, which motivates me to apply for GSoC.

1. __Why did you choose your specific project topic?__

    I'm very interested in machine learning and discovered PyMC a while ago; I actually started contributing before I knew about GSoC. I later discovered GSoC and realized this project was a good fit for my skills.

1. __How did you get involved in open source software?__

    As I didn't have the time to actively contribute, I started by fixing minor bugs in libraries and tools I came across in general. I began by sending small pull requests to PyMC, Scikit-learn, Python, Pandas, and other libraries that I had been using while learning Machine Learning. I learned about GSoC project openings in the PyMC organization and applied for it.

1. __What are you expecting or hoping to get out of your GSoC experience?__

    I'm hoping to interact and share ideas with some amazing people during the 12 weeks of GSoC. In the end, I hope to have made some wonderful friends from all over the world with whom I can talk about fun projects, get feedback on my code, and just about anything else. I'm hoping to meet nice, knowledgeable, and smart people who are all gathered in one place, united, and working toward a common goal.

1. __What are your career goals? How do you see the GSoC program moving you towards them?__

    I want to pursue a career in software development and the GSoC experience will help me to gain the skills I need to design and implement large and highly optimized software.
